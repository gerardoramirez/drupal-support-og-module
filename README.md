drupal-support-og-module
========================

Drupal 7 | Module to allow the Support and OG module to co - exist

The support_og module allows for the Support module and the Organic Groups module to integrate with each others features and allow the node access to behave correctly.

Be sure to enable the View other users tickets permission settings.  This will allow users to view tickets other than those assigned to or created by self but
allow the Organic Groups to set an audience restriction on those nodes that should only be accesssible via memembers.  You have to set this up in order for the 
comments to work correctly.   Without this on, the nodes will be accessible, but the comments will not.
